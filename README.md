# HttpCore

HttpCore is a service layer that implements an HTTP client (HttpClient). This service layer facilitates and accelerates the use of the .NET http client to consume and integrate different APIs.

### Installation

HttpCore is available via:

* NuGet Official Releases: [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/HttpCore.svg?label=NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HttpCore)

```
Install-Package HttpCore -Version 0.9.0
```

## Getting Started

Once you have added the package to your project, you just have to instantiate the HttpService class and use one of the following methods:

- **SendAsync<T<T>>**. This method is designed to make **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE** requests.

- **SendObjectAsync<T<T>>**. This method is intended for requests in which data has to be sent (**POST**, **PUT**, **PATCH**).

The generic T that is included in the call represents the type of the error entity that is going to capture our HttpService instance. For this, the **HttpServiceException** type is provided to capture exceptions produced in the HttpService layer.

### Example SendAsync to get a oAuth token from twitter API

```C#
using(HttpService httpService = new HttpService())
{
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(url))
    {
        ...
        try
        {
          var response = await httpService.SendAsync<ErrorsList>(CustomHttpMethod.Post, url, "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", param, headers);

          if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(response))
          {
              oAuthToken = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<OAuthToken>(response);
          }
        }
        catch (HttpServiceException<ErrorsList> exTwitter)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Http service exception:");
            exTwitter.Error.Errors.ForEach(error => Console.WriteLine($"Label:{error.Label} Error: {error.Message} StatusCode: {error.Code}"));
        }
        catch(Exception ex) 
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Unexpected error: {ex.ToString()}");
        }
    }
}
```

### Example SendObjectAsync

```C#
...
public class Request
{
    [JsonProperty("question")]
    public string Question { get; set; }

    [JsonProperty("top")]
    public int Top { get; set; }
}
...
using(HttpService httpService = new HttpService())
{
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(url))
    {
        ...
        try
        {
            var request = new Request { Question = "Test", Top = 5 };
            var response = await httpConnector.SendObjectAsync<ErrorResponse>(CustomHttpMethod.Post, url, request, "application/json", headers);

            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(response))
            {
                qnaResponse = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Response>(response);
            }
        }
        catch (HttpServiceException<ErrorResponse> apiEx)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Http service exception:");
            apiEx.Error.Errors.ForEach(error => Console.WriteLine($"Label:{error.Label} Error: {error.Message} StatusCode: {error.Code}"));
        }
        catch(Exception ex) 
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Unexpected error: {ex.ToString()}");
        }
    }
}
```
